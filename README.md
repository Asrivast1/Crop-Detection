# CropDetection
This is just a demo of crop detection using imageAI. Kivy has been used to provide the modest GUI.
The file image which is to be detected must be placed in the Test folder and the name of the image must be given as input.
Run TheRisingSun.py file in terminal and provide the image name as input as the application window opens.
